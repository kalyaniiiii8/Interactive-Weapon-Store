# Interactive Weapon Store
## Language: C++

This is an interactive Weapon Store which uses file handling and concepts of OOP to carry out purchases.
It also includes some animations.
The screenshots can be found in the respective folder.

The original version was made on Turbo C++ and uses some header files which are now obsolete (like `dos.h` and `graphics.h`).
Hence it runs only on DOSBox.

The linux version is modified to run on most of the widely used compiler programs especially the gnome terminal.
